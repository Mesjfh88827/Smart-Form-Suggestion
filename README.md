# Smart Form Suggestion — Front-End Prototype

A small front-end prototype demonstrating smart form suggestions (client-side simulation of AI behavior).
Built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
- Real-time suggestions for job title, skills and city using fuzzy search.
- "Auto Suggest" smart engine that proposes values based on other fields (heuristic rules).
- Click-to-accept suggestion chips to fill fields quickly.
- Simple, lightweight, easy to extend.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo or download files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or deploy to GitHub Pages).

## Next steps (improvements)
- Replace heuristics with real AI via API (OpenAI, Azure, local models).
- Add user history & personalization (localStorage).
- Add server-side endpoint for privacy & advanced ML.
- Add usage analytics & A/B testing.
